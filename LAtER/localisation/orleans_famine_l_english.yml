orleans_famine.1.d:0 "This year has not been good to us. We lost most of our harvest this year due to monstrous floods, the Mississippi seems unhappy and so are the people. Some say it's the end times, some say it's punishment, but with some skillful engineering the damage seems to have been contained. Yet, the Catholic minority is stirring, voices are spreading, pilgrims are flocking to our capital and some speak of a new order. We know not what the future brings."
